# Story Builder App

## Overview

Welcome to the **Story Builder App**! It is an innovative approach to building stories collaboratively.
CreateStory.io allows users to collaboratively create stories by contributing comments. Each user's perspective enriches the narrative, resulting in unique and engaging stories that reflect the creativity of multiple contributors.

**Note:** This is a demo version of the app, as it currently lacks a backend. The user interactions are simulated through a frontend interface that mocks contributions from different users.

## Features

- **Create New Stories**: Easily start a new story by giving it a title and a brief description.
- **Rename Stories**: Update the title of your stories whenever inspiration strikes!
- **Remove Stories**: Delete stories you no longer want to keep.
- **Commenting**: Write comments on each story to share your thoughts, ideas, and plot suggestions.
- **Like Comments**: Show appreciation for the best comments by liking them.
- **Preview Full Story**: View a complete narrative that integrates all comments into a cohesive story.
